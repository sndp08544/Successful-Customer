Build a model which can predict whether a visitor to the website can be a successful customer

An education company sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested 
in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.

The company requires me to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers 
with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance.

Now the company targets the customers with high lead scores who are more likely to take up the course
